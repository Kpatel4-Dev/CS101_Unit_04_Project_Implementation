## You get to make your own program!

### This is an opportunity to be creative and apply the content of this course.

#### Your final project must meet the following criteria:

- Be written in Snap! or Python
- Be an original work (something you create, not copy).
- Include all of the following in a meaningful way:
      * output (via console, GUI, or say block)
      * user input
      * repetition structure (loop)
      * branching structure (if/then)
      * at least one original custom function/block per team member
      * at least one of: list, GUI, or file input/output

- Be well-documented to indicate what the different parts are for, cite any resources, and if working in a team each member should indicate the sections they wrote.
